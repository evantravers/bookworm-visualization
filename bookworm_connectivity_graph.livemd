# Bookworm Connectivity Graph

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req, "~> 0.3.0"},
  {:req_easyhtml, "~> 0.1.0"},
  {:kino_explorer, "~> 0.1.4"}
])
```

## Why?

[Bookworm](https://bookworm.fm/) is one of my favorite podcastss. Like many listeners I use it as a filter to find quality books to add to my queue. I love how the hosts don't just read but engage with the material, holding each other accountable with takeaways and challenges.

A recurring joke in Bookworm is how many times they refer to [Ep. 42, How To Read a Book by Mortimer Adler](https://bookworm.fm/42/). The last few times they've made that joke… I've wanted to actually visualize that… graph. I know Mike loves Obsidian, I love Elixir and have been learning Livebook… let's play!

## Scraping

The first thing is to scrape the pages for processing and evaluation. One lovely thing about Livebook is that if you structure each code block separately, it intelligently memoizes each variable and only re-evaluates them if the structure changes.

Bookworm's website is structured logically. The most recent episode is the top `<h2>` on the page, and every episode will be in the form `https://bookworm.fm/1/` up to `https://bookworm.fm/<current>/`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Previously, I had used [HTTPoison](https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison) to do some downloading, but my friend [Seth](http://megalithic.io) has recommended [Req](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req), so let's give that a whirl.

Adding the following to the setup:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req, "~> 0.3.0"}
])
```

Now I can see if I can hit the opening page:

```elixir
Req.get!("https://bookworm.fm/").body
```

Success! Let's be a little more intentional.

The most recent post is the top `<h2>` on the page.

Adding the [req_easyhtml](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req_easyhtml) plugin to dependencies.

```elixir
req =
  Req.new()
  |> ReqEasyHTML.attach()
```

Now I can hone the CSS selector I need to get the most current link. What's really nice (again) about Livebook is that as I rerun the code over and over… I'm not pummeling my internet friends' server with requests. Livebook's cells have localized and memoized all the variables.

```elixir
most_recent_episode_number =
  Req.get!(req, url: "https://bookworm.fm/").body["h2:first-of-type"]["a"]
  |> Map.to_list()
  |> Keyword.get(:nodes)
  |> List.first()
  |> elem(1)
  |> Map.new()
  |> Map.get("href")
  |> String.split("/", trim: true)
  |> List.last()
  |> String.to_integer()
```

☝️ This is a super gross way to do this, but I can fix it later.

* [ ] TODO: Fix this grossness.

Anyway. Excelsior!

```elixir
raw_episodes =
  Enum.map(1..most_recent_episode_number, fn num ->
    url = "https://bookworm.fm/#{num}/"

    %{
      url: url,
      request: Req.get!(req, url: url)
    }
  end)
```

The first time I tried this, I forgot the trailing slash at the end of the URL and was getting tons of redirects (I'm guessing to the URI with the trailing slash.) 🤷

Let's do some cleanup on this… we don't care about all the html, just the bit inside the main area.

```elixir
episodes =
  raw_episodes
  |> Enum.map(fn %{request: request} = episode ->
    article = request.body["article"]

    episode
    |> Map.put(:article, article)
    |> Map.put(:links, article["a"])
  end)
```

Everytime I create one of these tiny blocks, it feels wrong to my DRY-trained programming brain, but I know from experience with Livebooks that it rewards little iterative steps.

I've thought of a several different things I want to do with this:

* a table of "most linked to episodes"
* a graph showing all the links
* transformation to markdown notes that could be stuck in someone's (*cough* Mike *cough*) Obsidian.

Let's go!

## Stats and Tables

I thought that the first thing I'm going to need to do is to transform this list of raw bodies into something that we can actually work with and display as a table.

I started to add a Smart Cell Data Explorer, which will automatically add dependencies for all it's plugins and things… but I'm running into it freaking out over the EasyHTML/Floki structs... let's go for the throat and try the graph.

* https://kroki.io/

```elixir
episodes
|> Enum.map(fn ep ->
  %{
    url: ep[:url],
    number_of_links: Enum.count(ep[:links])
  }
end)
|> Explorer.Series.from_list()
```
